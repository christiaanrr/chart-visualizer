# chart-visualizer
Patient medical history visualization using Unity and Leap Motion for real world interatability. Built patient history infrastructure featuring MedicalEvent objects that captured various key events, categorized by a tag and color. By parsing a patient chart into fields injectable to our patient object, each medical event is superimposable on the patient body at the site of damage/diagnosis/complaint/operation etc...

The Leap motion was used to interact with the 3D patient model. Various gestures are supported, including grabbing to rotate the patient, and zooming to a particular region on the body. 

Built for LA Hacks 2018.
